## What is PYRE?

PYRE takes a fundamentally different approach to financial planning. Instead of rigid categories and assumptions, it provides a flexible math language that lets you model your finances exactly how you want.

Define your current portfolio, add financial events (home purchases, investments, income streams), and watch your future unfold across customizable graphs. Everything from simple savings to complex loan amortization is handled through intuitive "blocks" that you can configure and combine.
